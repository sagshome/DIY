    <b>Welcome to investments</b>.  The purpose of this application is to provide a mechanism to visualize your investments
    and provide some comparison abilities.     I am based in Canada,  so I focused on the TSX and US markets.  I track
    changes to the value of our dollars and Canadian Inflation.  This provides the ability for me to see how well I am
    doing with regard to inflation.  On dividend accounts,  I also factor in withdraws, so I get a better value on my real
    return.

    <b>A few basics before we start</b>.  I have only focused on CANadian and US equity markets.   If you want me to
    look at something else feel free to work with <a href="mailto:itsonlyourmoney@gmail.com" target="_blank">me</a>, it
    is a hobby, so I don't mind digging in to help others out.<br><br>
    I have broken things up into accounts and portfolios.    you can have as many as you want you can copy them change them a watch
    you real or virtual investments grow.<br><br>
    I use <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Finance</a> and <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alpha
    Vantages</a> to get daily stock price values.  I only update once
    a day (since I have the free key).  You can get your own key and plug it into your profile and then do you own updates.
    if you wish.
</p>
<p>This page lists all your portfolios and their current values.   You can work portoflios by hand or you can do an
import.  The import is quite complex and I only support a few formats right now.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Effective Cost - is the funds invested, less the money withdrawn</li>
    <li>Start/End  - are the dates the account was active from</li>
    <li>Present Value - is the value as of my last update (usually last evening after market close</li>
    <li>Growth - is the change in Value based on the Effective cost</li>
    <li>Total Dividends - Are the dividends earned in this account</li>
</ul>
It is important to note that dividends that are not withdrawn do not lower effective cost.  If they remain as cash
in the account they are just that.   In the same vane,  Total Dividends does not mean the cash is available.  It could
have been withdrawn or reinvested.
