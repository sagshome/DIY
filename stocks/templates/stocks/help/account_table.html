        <h4>Data Views</h4>
        <p>
            While the default view for looking at account or portfolio data is the chart view, this the <b>Data View</b>
            is
            where most of the work happens. The general idea behind the Data View is to provide a month-over-month
            summary and
            provide a mechanism to correct data. Data usually only needs to be correct if transactions were missing or
            incorrect.
        </p>

        <h4>Account Types</h4>
        <p>The data view is tuned based on account types.</p>
        <li><b>Bank</b> Accounts - You simply edit/record the balance each month</li>
        <li><b>Value</b> A little more complicated than a bank account. You still do the monthly value
            updates, but you can add any funds deposited
            or withdrawn in that time period. This allows us to track return on investment
        </li>

        <li><b>Investment</b> Accounts hold multiple equities, so we provide a
            <button class="w3-button-small w3-round-large diy-button-auto diy-green">Reconcile</button>
            button to update indivdual account entities. Most Equities/ETFs we can look up via our APIs so we can
            calculate value (price * shares) and even find out if dividends were paid.

        </li>
        <h4>Portfolios vs Accounts</h4>
        The data will look the same, but you can not reconcile at the portfolio level. You must tunnel down to an
        account
        <h4>Transactions</h4>
        To help you make sense of the value, a second table to the left is provided listing all the transactions that
        apply
