    <b>Portfolio Details</b>.  This somewhat busy page is likely the most important.   The main summary is the first line,
    it has the total funding and the total funds redeemed.  That is what I refer to as the Effective Cost.

<h4>Return vs Cost</h4>
<b>Inflated cost</b>,  takes into account
    what inflation does to the value of your funds.   A 10K investment overtime should continually drop since inflation
    eats away at the value.   <b>Effective Cost</b> Is the total of Invested Funds less any dividends withdrawn regardless
    of inflation.  It should be higher than the value, or you are really loosing money.   Lastly <b>Value</b> is the
    actual value,  again regardless of inflation.
<h4>Equity Summary</h4>
This table is any equity you ever had in this portfolio.   It has the current share
<h4>Portfolio Transaction</h4>
This is the pertinent activities.  I don't include dividends, but you can see them as well as historic prices by selecting
the equity in the equity summary table.
