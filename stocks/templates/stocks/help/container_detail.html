    <b>Chart view</b>.  This somewhat busy page is likely the most important.   The main summary is the first line,

<h4>Bar Chart</h4>
<p>The Portfolio view will present a bar chart for each account in the portfolio whereas an Account view will show the

<h4>Portfolio Transaction</h4>
This is the pertinent activities.  I don't include dividends, but you can see them as well as historic prices by selecting
the equity in the equity summary table.
