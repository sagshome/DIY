How to deal with stock splits.

I noticed that my CIBC stocks split about a year ago.   The way the API records this is via "adjusted dividends".   This
means that the historic dividends are report as a fraction 1/2 on on a 2x1 split.    Since this is in the past I can,
 1) Adjust the original number of stocks to match the split price and leave dividends alone
 2) Adjust the historic dividends to match the original number of stocks and then split my my stocks on split day

 If I was already recording this and the stock in the future split,   I would have already recorded original dividends
 so I would not have the issue of 1 above,  unless I wiped out all the history of dividends.

 M1  Value 100     Dividend 10  Stocks 5 (payout 50 - Value 100)
 M2  Value 103     Dividend 0   Stocks 5 (payout 0 - Value +3
 M3  Value 51.5    Dividend 5   Stocks 10   (50) <- split
 M4  Value 50      Dividend 0
 M5  Value 51      Dividend 5   Stocks 10 (50)

 If I reimport I would have

 M1  Value 100     Dividend 5   Stocks 5 (25)
 M2  Value 103     Dividend 0   Stocks 5
 M3  Value 51.5    Dividend 5   Stocks 5   (50) <- split
 M4  Value 50      Dividend 0
 M5  Value 51      Dividend 5   Stocks 10 (50)

 To deal with retro-active I have an event called Adjusted Split,   in the future,  I would hae just Split.
