    <h4>Add Expense Item</h4>
    When Adding a new expense you must provide the Date,  the Amount,  the Description.  You may assign categories or
    even set it to be ignored.

    <h4>Edit Expense Item</h4>
    When Editing an expense you can not alter the Date,  the Amount,  or the Description.  You may assign categories or
    set it to be ignored/hidden.<br><br>

    <b>Amortize</b> Some expense are so large they skew that charts.   My best example of this is buying a car (with
    cash),
    this causes that month to go through the roof,  making all other months data impossible to read.   The two obvious
    solutions are
    <ol>
        <li>Ignore/Hide the record - Fixes the charts, but it would then skew how much I spend on transportation</li>
        <li>Amortize It - Spreed the joy out over a longer period of time</li>
    </ol>The choice is yours.  With amortization, you
    can spread the "payments" over the past months the future months or both.   My personal preference is to spread it
    out over the past months like I had been saving up for it all along.

    <b>Split</b> Sometimes you may want to assign multiple categories to an expense.  This can be done via the split
    action.   Enter the amount you want to split-off and give it a new description.   This will make two new items and
    automatically hide the first.
